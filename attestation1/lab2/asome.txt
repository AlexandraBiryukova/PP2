Personal Situation
 Your work and own life balance depends on the type of company you work for. Office hours can be anywhere between 8am - 6pm, Monday to Friday.  In some organizations you may have the opportunity to work remotely or on a flexible schedule. But there is a possibility of short-terms projects, when you have to work outside your core office ours or at weekends if it is necessary.
